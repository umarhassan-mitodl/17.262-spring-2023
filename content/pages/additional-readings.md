---
The additional readings are for your use, in case you are interested in diving in deeper, or you have read some of the required readings before. Mostly, the additional readings are intended to group together classic readings we don’t have time to get into the major topics of the class. I have placed chapters from the *Oxford Handbook of the American Congress* at the beginning of most additional reading sections. This is a good resource for literature reviews on the topic, published in 2011.
