### Discussion Agenda Memos

You will write brief, two-page memos, due the afternoon before each class meeting, about the points you want to discuss at the next day’s seminar. A list of bullet points is fine. The goal is to get us thinking ahead of time about the topics that interest you.

### “General Exam” Essays
